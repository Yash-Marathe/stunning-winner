Health insurance secures your finances during a medical emergency or planned hospitalisation by covering for your hospital costs and other expenses as mentioned in your policy document. With advancement in medical technologies and treatments the cost of healthcare is also rising with every single day. Having a health insurance plan can take care of such expenses helping one immensely safeguard finances without worrying about the impending medical bills. A comprehensive health insurance plan provides a wide range of coverage like cashless hospitalisation, OPD expenses, daily cash, diagnostic costs and more. It gives coverage to an individual or family members included in the plan up to the sum insured.  
At HDFC ERGO we have been dedicated in making your lives easier with our products and have relaunched our my:Optima Secure extending our coverage worldwide with 2 Unique Services: Early discharge and Cashless approval for chronic diseases for seamless claim experience. A health insurance plan also helps in tax savings under Section 80 D of ITA.

### Fixed benefit Health Insurance Plan

While indemnity-based health insurance and top-up plans pay for medical bills on an actual basis, a lump sum benefit plan pays a lump sum amount in one go. It's beneficial for meeting endless medical expenses arising out of critical ailments such as Stroke, Cancer, Paralysis, Multiple Sclerosis, etc. While buying a health insurance plan many are in a dilemma to choose between an indemnity plan and a fixed benefit plan. Ideally having the security of both ensures larger coverage.

Save Tax with Health Insurance Policy The Earlier, The Better
-------------------------------------------------------------

It is always advisable to buy a good health insurance plan as early as possible because health emergencies can happen anytime, without any prior notice. The following points will make it even clearer, why it is important to buy a health insurance policy at an early age:

1

#### Comparatively Lower Premium

Premium is comparatively lower when you get a health policy at a young age. This reason for it is that, for the insurance company, the lower the age, the lesser is the health risk associated.

2

#### Skip Mandatory Health Check-up

In certain cases, you might be excused from the mandatory health check-ups that people of a certain age must undergo to obtain health insurance.

3

#### Shorter Waiting Period

Health insurance policies have waiting periods for a few health conditions. If you purchase a mediclaim policy when you’re young, you complete them sooner.

Reasons Why People Avoid Buying Health Insurance Policy
-------------------------------------------------------

#### 

Scenario 1

Dependency On Employer’s Health Insurance plan

Most of us consider employee health insurance as a secured cover for taking care of medical expenses. However, you must know that employer health insurance covers you only during your job tenure. Once you leave the company or switch jobs, you lose your health insurance benefits. Some companies do not offer health cover during initial probation period. Even if you have a valid corporate health cover it may offer a lower sum insured, lack modern medical coverage and may also ask you to co-pay for claims. Hence, always have a personal health insurance plan for yourself and your family to be double sure.

#### 

Scenario 2

Unaware Of The Benefits Of Including Health Insurance in Financial Planning

Just like you pay EMIs, credit card bills, invest in mutual funds or pay premium for life insurance plans to ensure a sound financial planning, similarly you need to buy a health insurance to secure your savings in the longer run. Because, most of us do not realize the importance of health insurance until something fatal hits us or people around us. Lack of awareness may hamper your savings if an unexpected medical expense comes up.

#### 

Scenario 3

Thinking a Higher Sum Insured Might Not Be Necessary

It is important to understand that you need a higher sum insured if you reside in a metro city where medical treatment expenses are high. If a single hospitalization in a year is enough to exhaust your sum insured then you should consider a higher sum insured. Just buying a health insurance won’t help in the long run. Getting a sum insured that’s enough to cover your medical expenses is equally important. Also, if you are covering more family members then consider taking a health insurance policy with a sum insured above 10 lacs.

#### 

Scenario 4

Miscalculating The Benefits of Premium Vs Coverage

Don’t just look at the premium and go back thinking if you should buy this health insurance plan. Looking at the list of coverage and benefits before buying a health insurance plan is important and should not be overlooked. If you think of buying a health insurance plan with a low premium then there are high chances that you may miss out critical coverage. In future, you may feel that certain coverage is important but your policy doesn’t cover it. Scout for a health insurance plan that is not just pocket friendly but also value for money.

#### 

Scenario 5

Buying Health insurance Only To Save Tax

Many of us buy health insurance just to save tax under section 80 D. A health insurance plan helps you save tax upto ₹ 1 lac\*\*\*\*. However, there is a lot more beyond saving taxes. Get yourself a health insurance plan that helps you during critical times and helps in saving finances in the long run. You must also get a health insurance plan for your parents, spouse, and kids to ensure complete financial security.

#### 

Scenario 6

Undermining the importance of buying a health insurance at a younger age

If you are young, hale and hearty you should buy a health insurance plan now to get lower premiums. Secondly, if you do not make claims post buying a health insurance cover you get cumulative bonus, which gives you hike in sum insured without charging extra premium as a reward for staying fit. Thirdly, every health policy comes in with waiting period, so if you buy health insurance while you are young your waiting period gets over during the initial years. Later, if you have any disease your policy covers you seamlessly. Lastly, looking at the pandemic situation it’s not wrong to say that any one at any point of time may need hospitalisation if not due to ailment may be due to an accidental injury; hence it’s important to stay prepared.

How to Choose the Right Health Insurance Plan
---------------------------------------------

Every time you look for a health insurance plan, you wonder which is the best health insurance plan? How to choose the best health plan online? What coverage should it have? To answer all your queries let’s read more to decode the hacks to get the right health insurance plan.

1

#### Ensure Adequate Sum Insured

If you are looking to insure yourself consider a health insurance plan with a sum insured ranging between 7 lacs to 10 lacs. For a family a policy the sum insured could range between 8 to 15 lakhs on floater basis. Remember, your health insurance plan should be adequate to cover for more than one hospitalisation that may happen in a year.

2

#### Choose The Right Premium

Health insurance premiums are quite affordable. So when you chose a plan, don’t make a hasty decision of paying low premiums for a smaller sum insured and then co-pay your hospital bills later. You might end up paying hefty amount for your medical bills. Instead, work on a co-payment clause that’s easy on your pocket.

3

#### Check Network Of Hospitals

Always check if the insurance company has a wide list of network hospitals included in your health insurance plan. Also check, if the nearest hospital or medical facility is listed by the insurance company, so it will help you avail cashless treatment. At HDFC ERGO, we have a huge network of 12,000+ Cashless Health care centers.

4

#### No Sub-limits Help

Usually your medical expenses depend upon your room type and disease. It is recommended to buy a health insurance plan that does not have sub-limits on hospital room rent so that you can choose the hospital room as per your comfort. Most of our policies also don’t imply disease sublimit; this is also an important factor one must keep in mind.

5

#### Check Waiting Periods

Your health insurance plan does not come into action while you are waiting period is not completed. Always check health insurance policies with lower waiting periods for pre-existing ailments and [maternity cover](/health-insurance/maternity-cover)
 benefits before buying a health insurance plan online.

6

#### Choose A Trusted Brand

Always choose a health insurance company that has a good reputation in the market. You must also look at the customer base and claim paying ability to know if the brand will honor the claims that you may make in future. Choosing a health insurance plan is a commitment of both policyholder and insurer, so take a decision calmly.

What is a Mediclaim Policy?
---------------------------

![Mediclaim insurance](https://www.hdfcergo.com/images/default-source/health-insurance/shutterstock_1639437607-(1).jpg?sfvrsn=7ee92f2a_2 "Mediclaim insurance")

Mediclaim insurance is a type of insurance that provides financial coverage for medical expenses. It is designed to help individuals and families manage the costs associated with hospital stays, medical procedures, and other health care needs. The policy covers all hospitalization expenses, such as room and board, medication, and other treatments. It may also cover domiciliary expenses, which are costs associated with health care services received outside of the hospital, such as home health care or day-care procedures. The amount of coverage you receive depends on the sum insured that you have purchased. In some cases, you may need to provide proof of expenses, such as hospital bills or discharge reports, in order to be reimbursed.  
Mediclaim insurance is sometimes referred to as health insurance, and the two terms are often used interchangeably. The coverage, claim settlement process, and additional benefits offered under a mediclaim policy are similar to those offered under a health insurance policy.  
Under a mediclaim policy, you do not necessarily need to be hospitalized to receive benefits. For example, you may be able to receive home health care benefits without actually being hospitalized. Additionally, mediclaim policies often offer the flexibility to add family members, increase the sum insured, and add additional benefits as needed. Some policies may also offer co-payment options, which allow you to share the costs with the insurance company.  
In conclusion, mediclaim insurance is a type of medical insurance that provides financial coverage for health care expenses. It is synonymous with health insurance and offers similar coverage, benefits, and flexibility.

While your customer support and services are top class, I wish you disbursed the reimbursements soon too, as it makes it difficult for one to deal with financial pressures during a treatment. Other than that I am happy with your services and would definitely recommend my friends to get a policy from HDFC ERGO.

I am happy and thankful for your support and services extended to me, however, I think your reimbursement process should be a bit swift in settling the claims for both pre and post-hospitalisation through telephonic discussions.

If tobacco is consumed in any form, the chances of an individual developing some health issue later in life is higher, and this means you might have to claim the treatment cost. So, these individuals are categorized as high-risk by the insurance company and high premiums are charged from them.

#### 

6\. What do you mean by cumulative bonus in a health insurance policy?

The bonus/ reward that one gets for remaining fit and not filing a claim is known as a cumulative bonus. The cumulative bonus benefit is given in the renewal year by increasing the sum insured amount only up to a certain year for every claim-free year. This helps you to get a higher Sum Insured without paying anything extra.[](https://www.hdfcergo.com/blogs/health-insurance/concept-of-no-claim-or-cumulative-bonus-in-health-insurance)
