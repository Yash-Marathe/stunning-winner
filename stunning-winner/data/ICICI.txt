A health insurance policy offers coverage for any future medical expenses of the customer.

This is an agreement between the insurance company and the customer where the former agrees to guarantee payment/compensation~ for medical costs if the latter is injured/ill in the future, leading to hospitalisation.

Make sure your health plan covers a wide range of medical problems and can help you avail of various pre and post-hospitalisation benefits. If the health insurance you have bought is for your family, it is necessary to make sure that it covers the needs of all the family members

![](https://www.iciciprulife.com/content/dam/icicipru/products/health-insurance/choosetherightkind.png)

As much as it is important that the health plan meets your needs, it is equally important that it also suits your budget. As your income increases, and the size of your family as well as requirements change over time, the plan can further be reviewed accordingly

![](https://www.iciciprulife.com/content/dam/icicipru/products/health-insurance/choosetherightkind.png)

According to your status, select an individual or [family health plan](/health-insurance/family-health-insurance.html)
. If you have a family who needs your support, opt for a family health plan so as to reap maximum benefits at a comparatively low cost

![](https://www.iciciprulife.com/content/dam/icicipru/products/health-insurance/choosetherightkind.png)

It is important to know the term for which the policy would cover you. After all, one is more likely to require medical facilities at a later stage in life, as we approach old age. Therefore, a plan which offers lifetime renewability would be more beneficial

![](https://www.iciciprulife.com/content/dam/icicipru/products/health-insurance/choosetherightkind.png)

It is always better to choose an insurance provider that has a wide network of hospitals included in its list. One should also check if the hospitals one prefers are included in the list or not

![](https://www.iciciprulife.com/content/dam/icicipru/products/health-insurance/choosetherightkind.png)

It is advisable to choose an insurance provider with a higher [claim settlement ratio](/insurance-claim/claim-settlement-ratio.html)
. The claim settlement ratio is the number of claims settled by the insurance provider over the total number of claims received

Does your Health Insurance cover COVID-19 claims?
-------------------------------------------------

With the COVID-19 pandemic being the biggest medical concern of the world right now, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has made it mandatory that all health insurance products must cover the treatment and hospitalisation cost of COVID-19 as well. If the insured person has been hospitalised for more than 24 hours after being diagnosed with COVID-19, the insurance policy will cover the hospitalisation costs. There are also several insurance schemes that will cover pre and post-hospitalisation care as well as quarantine related expenses in registered centres. Some policies may also include ICU charges. These are all subject to the terms and conditions of the policy and it is therefore advisable that one contacts the insurance company to gain further clarification on all the expenses covered.

Below are some common elements covered under health insurance plans:

*   Hospitalisation expenses: Health insurance usually covers the cost of hospitalisation, including room charges, nursing expenses and other associated fees

*   Emergency care: Health insurance covers emergency medical treatment

What is not Covered under a Health Insurance Policy?

*   Health insurance policies often have a waiting period for pre-existing medical conditions and expenses related to these conditions may not be covered for a certain period after the policy's effective date

##### Affordability

##### Flexibility

Factors Affecting Your Health Insurance Premium
-----------------------------------------------

Below are some factors that can impact the premium for health insurance plans:

*   Family Medical History  
    Your premium can be affected by your family's medical history. If your family has a history of hereditary diseases, you may be considered at higher risk of contracting them. This can result in a higher premium.
*   Age and Gender  
    Your age and gender can impact the premium for your health insurance plan. Health insurance premium tends to increase as you get older, as your health is more likely to suffer. Gender may also affect the premium, as healthcare needs differ for men and women.
*   Policy Term  
    Longer-term policies may have a higher premium compared to short-term policies. However, long-term policies offer better protection by ensuring financial protection for an extended period. Short-term policies may seem more affordable but can come with additional costs for renewal, which can be more expensive in the long run.
*   Pre-Existing Diseases People with pre-existing medical conditions typically pay a higher premium. Insurance companies charge more to cover potential medical expenses related to these conditions.
*   Lifestyle  
    Lifestyle habits like smoking, alcohol consumption and others may result in a higher premium as they enhance the chance of falling sick. On the other hand, a healthy lifestyle may lead to a lower premium.

Why are many of the policyholders underinsured?
-----------------------------------------------

Many policyholders buy [insurance](/insurance.html)
 to save taxes. The purpose of insurance is security during unforeseen circumstances- not to save tax, it is just an ancillary benefit. The market is filled with a variety of insurance products. However, different products suit different people and if research is not done properly, people usually end up buying policies with higher premiums and inadequate covers

Why Buy a Health Insurance Plan at an Early Age?
------------------------------------------------

*   One can avail lower premiums as the premium amount is usually determined on the basis of the current age and health status of the policyholder, by insurance providers
*   One can enjoy tax\* benefits for a longer duration. One can claim the premium deducted from the income under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act, 1961
*   Insurance providers exclude pre-existing conditions. As you grow older, you are more likely to have such conditions and if you buy a policy then, it won't cover them
*   As a young person, there are lesser health problems at the onset. This reduces the chances of the health insurance policy getting rejected
*   Along with better coverage, buying insurance at a young age helps in better financial planning. If the health aspect is taken care of, one can think of making other financial investments as well
*   We are trapped into sedentary lifestyles from a very young age, which lay the foundation of many critical illnesses. In such times, it becomes more important than ever to have a health insurance policy to keep one covered

Points to consider before choosing a Health Insurance Plan
----------------------------------------------------------

As you can see, there are various types of health insurance plans in the market. Therefore, choosing the most appropriate one can be confusing. When you select a health insurance plan, it is essential to compare different plans and choose the one that offers an affordable premium for comprehensive protection. Here are some factors that can help you choose a good health insurance plan for your needs:

*   A considerable number of network hospitals - It can be beneficial to look for a health insurance plan that covers a wide network of hospitals. Network hospitals simplify and speed up the claim process. They can help you save crucial time during an emergency. So, always check the list of networks hospitals and pick a health policy that covers treatment undertaken in hospitals close to your area of residence
*   Cashless hospitalisation facility - With cashless hospitalisation, you no longer have to worry about clearing bills. The hospital settles the bill with the insurance company internally, so you can solely focus on your health. The cashless hospitalisation feature offers convenience and can help you in your hour of need
*   A good claim settlement ratio - Claim settlement ratio is the percentage of the individual claims that an insurance company settles in a financial year out of the total claims received in the same financial year. A consistently high [Claim Settlement Ratio](/insurance-claim/claim-settlement-ratio.html)
     shows that the company is committed to the needs of its customers
*   Range of sum insured - If you have a good range of sum insured amounts to choose from, you have greater flexibility to select the amount you need. This enables you to pick a suitable health policy that can offer you adequate financial protection
*   A home care facility - Treatment is not limited to the hospital alone. Many illnesses can require long-term care at home. Therefore, it can help to look for a plan that covers medical expenses incurred at home, such as pre and post-hospitalisation expenses
*   Good customer rating and reviews - Customers ratings can be an excellent indicator of a health insurance plan. They can help you understand the services of the insurer. They can also offer a glimpse into the claim settlement process and how prompt the insurer is to solve the customer’s queries and issues. You can check online reviews and customer feedback to ensure that you pick the best insurance company

 Health Insurance will pay a premium of ₹ 119 per month (including taxes) for a ₹ 20 lakh cover3 for 20 years. But a 50-year-old Male for the same cover and duration will shell out ₹ 1652 per month (including taxes). Do note that the premium cost goes up if you are a smoker since they are prone to more health risks. A 20-year-old male who smokes will pay ₹ 132 per month for ₹ 20 lakh cover for 20 years as premium, about 11% more than a non-smoker.

### What are the things to look for while choosing a health insurance plan?

The best health insurance policy depends on your specific needs. There are a few important factors that one must look at while choosing a health insurance plan -

*   i) Payout mechanism - Whether payout happens on diagnosis, or on actual hospitalisation
*   ii) Claim Process - [Claim process](/insurance-claim/claim-process.html)
     should be simple, fast and efficient involving minimum discomfort to policyholder/family
*   iii) Waiting Period - The best plans will have minimal waiting period before you can claim for a pre-existing cover
*   iv) Adequate cover - With health costs on the rise, the best health plans will give maximum cover at an affordable cost
*   v) Pre/post hospitalisation benefit - Some health plans have limits related for pre and post hospitalisation expenses and so you must be aware of them before buying.

### Does health insurance provide tax benefits?

Yes, paying a health insurance premium every year can lower your annual tax liability. Health insurance premium paid can be used to claim deduction under Section 80D^. An individual can claim a deduction of up to ₹ 25,000 for the insurance of self, spouse, and dependent children. An additional deduction for the insurance of parents is available. This is to the extent of ₹ 25,000, if the parents are less than 60 years of age. The additional deduction can be up to ₹ 50,000 if the parents are aged above 60.

### What is the sum insured in medical insurance?

The sum insured in medical insurance refers to the maximum amount that the insurance provider is liable to pay in the event of the policyholder’s hospitalisation. If the hospitalisation expenses exceed the sum insured on the policy, it won’t be borne by the insurer. Instead, it has to be paid by the policyholder. For example, if the sum insured of a health insurance policy is ₹ 10 lakh and the hospitalisation expenses turn out to be ₹ 12 lakh, then ₹ 10 lakh will be paid by insurer and the policyholder will have to pay ₹ 2 lakh out of their pocket.

### Do health insurance plans cover diagnostic charges like X-ray, MRI or ultrasound?

Yes, the health insurance cover usually pays for them as long as the patient is hospitalized for at least 24 hours and such tests have been prescribed. Such tests done out-patients are not always covered, unless specified in the policy#1 . Please read your health insurance policy document to find out. In ICICI Pru Heart & Cancer health insurance, you get upfront payment for covered ailments, which means you can use them to pay for X-ray, MRI, Ultrasound, nurse and therapy related charges/tests pre and post hospitalisation at your own choice.

### What is a freelook period in health insurance?

As per the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), all insurers are mandated to offer a freelook period of at least 15 days on health insurance plans. A freelook period refers to the tenure during which a policyholder can review a health insurance plan bought by him/her and even cancel the policy if he or she is not satisfied with its benefits. The health insurance provider, in such a case, will have to return the premium amount paid by the policyholder.

### What are the documents required for buying a health insurance plan?

Generally, the following documents are required to buy health insurance

*   i) Age proof
*   ii) Identity proof
*   iii) Address proof
*   iv) Some plans may require medical check-up reports, usually for people above the age of 45
*   v) Passport size photo

### What is the right age to get health insurance?

The earlier you get health insurance, the lower is your premium amount. If you wait to buy a health insurance policy at later stages of life, you might be deprived of immediate coverage due to the waiting period$. So, it is better to buy health insurance as soon as you meet the minimum entry age requirements for the policy.

### What are pre-existing diseases or conditions in medical insurance?

As per the IRDAI, if a policyholder is diagnosed with a disease at least 48 months before buying a health policy, it is termed a pre-existing disease. Usually, health insurance companies provide coverage for these pre-existing diseases after a waiting period.

### Can a person have more than one health policy?

Of course, you can have more than one health policy. Many people have a separate health insurance policy apart from the health cover provided by their employer. You may use the second policy if you exhaust the health cover in the first one.

### Is medical test mandatory to purchase a health insurance policy?

Many health insurance plans issue policies without medical tests, depending on the age and medical history of the applicant. However, if your age is above the minimum age limit set by the insurer, then you will have to go through a medical test.

### Is there any difference between health insurance and a mediclaim policy?

Mediclaim is a type of health insurance plan that takes care of the policy-holder’s healthcare expenses in case he/she gets hospitalized due to an illness or an accident. These policies cover the policyholder for a defined time period and up to a predetermined limit known as the ‘sum assured’. These policies need to be renewed regularly to continue enjoying the benefits.

### How do I estimate the cost of health insurance?

You can calculate the premium for ICICI Pru Heart/Cancer Protect plan using this [calculator](/health-insurance-plans/icici-pru-heart-cancer-health-insurance-calculator.html?UID=35889#/basic-details)
.

### Can I add my family members to a health insurance policy cover?

Yes, you can add different family members to a health insurance plan. Usually, health insurance plans let you add the following family members to the same plan:

*   i) Spouse
*   ii) Dependent children (biological and legally adopted children)
*   iii) Dependent parents
*   iv) Dependent parents-in-law
*   v) Brothers and sisters

You can opt for a family floater health insurance plan if you wish to insure your loved ones. All insured members of a family floater plan can avail up to the maximum limit of the sum insured of the policy. Moreover, such plans extend the coverage to the entire family under a single premium. This saves a lot of time and money in the long run.

### Do I need to purchase additional health insurance plans to increase the sum assured amount?

There can be two ways to increase the sum assured amount of your health insurance plan. These are:

*   1) You could buy a new health plan with a higher sum assured
*   2) You could simply increase the sum assured of your plan at the time of policy renewal

### Will my health insurance plan work in non-network hospitals?

Yes, your health insurance plan will work in both network and non-network hospitals. However, you can claim the cashless facility at a network hospital only. If you were to seek treatment at a non-network hospital, you would not be able to use the cashless facility and might have to submit the bills of hospitalisation/treatment to request a claim.It may be advised to read and understand such details before signing the policy document. And remember that it helps to pick a health insurance policy that offers a vast network of hospitals.

### What happens if I am hospitalised and on the same day my health insurance plan has lapsed?

Typically, all insurance companies give customers a grace period of 15 – 30 days after the date of expiry. The customer can use this time to renew the plan and keep the policy running. However, it is important to understand that health insurance is given in return for the premiums paid. In the absence of a premium, the insurer is not obligated to offer you financial protection. Hence, till you renew your plan again, you will not receive any protection or benefits from your health plan. Therefore, it is advised to renew your plan in time and ensure that your plan is always active.

### What does cashless hospitalisation mean in a health insurance plan?

Cashless hospitalisation is a health insurance feature that allows you to avail of medical services at a hospital without making any upfront payments. Under this feature, the insurance company directly deals with the hospital and clears all hospital bills. However, this facility can only be availed at a network hospital specified in the health insurance plan.

### What if I already have a health insurance policy but I just want to increase my sum insured?

Almost all insurance companies in India allow you to increase your health insurance sum insured at the time of policy renewal. All you need to do is intimate your medical insurance provider that you want to increase the sum insured on your policy. However, this can result in an increase in your health insurance premium amount. You can also take a top-up plan on your health insurance policy to increase its sum insured.

### At what age can you include your children in the health insurance plan?

Family floater health insurance plans can be used to cover children between the ages of 90 days and 25 years. You can include your children in your plan anytime during this period.

### Can the nominee be changed in the mid-term of the health insurance policy?

Yes, health insurance plans allow you to change the nominee anytime during the policy term.

### Can a person have more than one health insurance policy?

Yes, you can have more than one health insurance policy from several insurers. Multiple health insurance policies can offer several benefits like wider coverage, safety from claim rejection, better features and more peace of mind.
